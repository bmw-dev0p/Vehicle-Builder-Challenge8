# Vehicle Builder 
  Created By: "Brad Webster" - in collaboration with edX Coding Bootcamp
  ## Description:
  This coding project is a practice project in javascript object oriented programming.
  I built this vehicle builder to show that I can take simple user input and create inheritance structures in the form of different vehicle types.
  While, it may not solve any real world problems, it does demonstrate best back-end coding practices.
  I learned deeply about Javascript classes, interfaces and imports from multiple file systems.
