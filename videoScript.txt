Hello, my name is Brad Webster and I am student software developer at the U of R
Welcome to my video! This is going to be a walkthrough of my coding project - Vehicle Builder.
This project is coded in Typescript that runs in Nodejs environment with no user interface except for text (keyboard) input.
This is because this is a back end practice project to demonstrate object oriented programming, specifically js classes and interfaces.

The way this is demonstrated is by taking user input to create 3 types of vehicles car, truck, motorcycle
It collects the more vehicle data from the user, like vin, make, model, color
It then takes the vehicle objects and implements a couple basic methods like driving (start engine, acc, dec, stop, reverse, etc)
A couple extra methods like tow other vehicle + wheelie

I think this is better explained by example, so Without further ado, lets walk through this program

Things that I would implement if I had more time:
Rework the Vehicle class to hold more common variables (vin, make, model, color)
Graphical User interface: (Buttons / images of cars)
